Golang library for both compressing and decompressing data in the PKWare Data Compression Library (DCL) compressed format,
otherwise known as "explode" and "implode" which differ from PKZIP.

Based on:

blast.c in ZLIB written by Mark Adler
https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/master/contrib/blast/blast.c

implode.c Ladislav Zezula 2003
https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/StormLib/blob/master/src/pklib/implode.c


### Installation

	go get github.com/JoshVarga/blast

### Features
    Compress ("implode") data using the PKWARE DCL "implode" method
    Decompress ("explode") data that has been compressed using PKWARE DCL "implode" method

### Example

```
func ExampleNewWriter() {
	var b bytes.Buffer
	w := blast.NewWriter(&b, blast.Binary, blast.DictionarySize1024)
	w.Write([]byte("AIAIAIAIAIAIA"))
	w.Close()
	fmt.Println(b.Bytes())
	// Output: [0 4 130 36 37 143 128 127]
}

func ExampleNewReader() {
	buff := []byte{0, 4, 130, 36, 37, 143, 128, 127}
	b := bytes.NewReader(buff)
	r, err := blast.NewReader(b)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	io.Copy(os.Stdout, r)
	// Output: AIAIAIAIAIAIA
	r.Close()
}
```
